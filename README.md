# Image_classification_LinearNN_MNIST
## Overview
The `LinerNN_MNIST_Image_Classification` repo focuses on training a linear neural network model to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the process of building and training a basic neural network, as well as evaluating its performance on a well-known machine learning dataset.

# Jupyter Notebook:
## This is likely where the main workflow of your model training and evaluation takes place. It may contain the following sections:
- Dataset: A section where you load and preprocess your dataset. This could involve reading from files (like images, CSVs, etc.), normalizing data, or augmenting it.
- DataLoader: A PyTorch DataLoader to handle batching and shuffling of the dataset.
- Model Architecture: Defines the neural network model. It could be a custom model or a pretrained one.
- Forward Pass: This defines how the data flows through the model during training and inference.
- Optimizer: A section where you define the optimization algorithm (like Adam, SGD, etc.) used to minimize the loss during training.
- Save Model: Saving the model's weights after training, so it can be reused for inference or fine-tuning later.
- Load Model: Loading a previously saved model for inference or continued training.

# Saved Model:
- This file will contain the trained weights and architecture of the model.
- It can be loaded into the model for inference or for continued training. Typically, this is saved in formats like .pth for PyTorch or .h5 for TensorFlow.

# Test Images Folder:
- This contains images that will be used for testing the trained model on unseen data.
- You would typically load these images, preprocess them (e.g., resizing, normalizing), and then pass them through the trained model to get predictions.
